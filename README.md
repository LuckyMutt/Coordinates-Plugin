# Coordinates

A simple plugin that displays your coordinates in the action bar.

## Commands and Permission

Here is a list of available commands and permission for each action.


| Command              | Permission | Description |
|----------------------|-----|------|
|                      | `coordinates.show` | This permission is needed so the player can see the actionbar with the coordinates |
| `coordinates (args)` | `coordinates.command.*` | With this permission the user has access to the full `/coordinates` command and his subcommands
| `/coordinates`       | `coordinates.command` | This will show the help message for the plugin |
| `/coordinates toggle` | `coordinates.command.toggle` | This allows the player to toggle the actionbar and show or hide it |

## Additional notes

I did a quick rework of the plugin for fun. So there are still some things that aren't perfect.
I currently have no way to test the plugin myself, but in theory it should work. Maybe some of the wacky message cast might throw some errors.

For the original author of the project: You did a great job to get your plugin working. While I checked your sourcecode I found some things I would do differently.
That's why I created this fork. Maybe if you check it you'll find some inspiration for your project.
